/**
 * Application Insights Connection String Configuration
 *
 * RECOMMENDED: Configure the connection string via web part properties instead of here.
 * This keeps sensitive data out of source control and allows per-instance configuration.
 *
 * To configure via web part properties:
 * 1. Add the web part to a SharePoint page
 * 2. Edit the web part and find "Application Insights Configuration" in the property pane
 * 3. Paste your connection string there
 *
 * FOR DEVELOPMENT ONLY: You can set your connection string here for local testing,
 * but DO NOT commit your actual connection string to source control.
 *
 * Get your connection string from Azure Portal > Application Insights > Overview
