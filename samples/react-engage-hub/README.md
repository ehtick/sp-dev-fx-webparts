# Engage Hub

## Summary

Built purely with off-the-shelf SharePoint capabilities, Engage Hub is a contemporary SPFx-based substitute for Viva Engage. In addition to providing essential social capabilities such as liking and unliking posts, threaded comments, and comment creation, it manages post data using SharePoint Lists and Document Libraries.

Engage Hub maintains responsiveness and light weight with its elegant React user interface and integrated infinite scrolling. Additionally, it incorporates an AI-powered twist by using the Azure OpenAI JavaScript SDK to assist users in revising content and correcting grammar mistakes.
