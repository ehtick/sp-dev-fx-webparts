# React Bubble Template

## Summary

Displays SharePoint list items as interactive circular bubbles. Each bubble can show an optional logo, title, optional description and act as a link. The bubbles use customizable background and text colors, and a soft shadow to give a lifted appearance. On hover bubbles gently enlarge and return to their original size.

|:---------------------------|
| Every SPFx version is optimally compatible with specific versions of Node.js. In order to be able to build this sample, you need to ensure that the version of Node on your workstation matches one of the versions listed in this section. This sample will not work on a different version of Node.|

## Prerequisites

### SharePoint List

Create (or reuse) a Custom List (default view OK). Recommended columns:

| Column | Type | Required | Notes |
|--------|------|----------|-------|
| Title | Single line | Yes | Bubble title |
| Description | Multiple lines (Plain) | No | Shown if present |
| Icon | Single line (Text) | No | Image URL (PNG/SVG/JPG/Data URI) |
| BackgroundColor | Single line (Text) | No | Hex (fallback palette if missing) |
| Color | Single line (Text) | No | Text/logo color hex (defaults to `#FFFFFF`) |
| Url | Single line (or Hyperlink) | No | Destination link (opens in new tab) |

### Web Part Property

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| listName | Title of the SharePoint list supplying data |

## Features

- Dataâ€‘driven bubbles (rendered from a SharePoint list)
- Custom background & text colors (per item)
- Soft, layered shadow for a lifted circle look
- Gentle hover scale with smooth return to original size
- Clickable bubbles that open links in a new tab

### UX details

- Hover effect: bubbles scale up slightly and gain z-index priority.
- The bubble shadow and subtle inset gradient create depth without additional decorative elements.

### Build and Test

1. `npm i`
2. `gulp build`
3. `gulp serve --nobrowser`
4. Open hosted workbench: `https://<tenant>.sharepoint.com/sites/<site>/_layouts/15/workbench.aspx`
5. Add the web part and set the List name.

## Troubleshooting

If something does not work:

1. Run environment diagnostics:
   `npx @pnp/cli-microsoft365 spfx doctor`
2. Confirm Node + SPFx version compatibility: <https://aka.ms/spfx-matrix>
3. Clear old build artifacts:
   `gulp clean && gulp build`
