## Features

This sample demonstrates advanced React patterns and modern web technologies through an engaging Office-themed breakout game:


### Architecture

- **HTML5 Canvas** for high-performance game rendering
- **Context API** for centralized game state management
- **Custom hooks** for reusable game logic
- **Provider pattern** to eliminate prop drilling


### Game

- **Smooth keyboard controls** with responsive paddle movement
- **Multiple game states** including pause, victory, and game over
- **Visual effects** with ball glow and gradient rendering
- **Canvas rendering** for efficient graphics operations
- **Image caching** for fast asset loading
- **requestAnimationFrame** for smooth animations
- **Optimized event handling** for responsive controls

### Motivation

All these techniques are typically used in business cases with computer vision and webcams, but here they are presented in a more fun way.
